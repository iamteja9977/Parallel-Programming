Note: In a module, when we run the entire module directly using:
	python3 modulename.py
	Then, the "__name__" inside that module becomes "__main__"
	But when we use that module inside some another python program,
	Then, the "__name__" inside that module becomes "modulename"
	Therefore, when we want to run a module directly,
	we can have a if condition like:
	if __name__ == "__main__":
		# do something

	python creates cache files in __pycache__ which contains .pyc files
	if you notice, these are cpython files.
	They are bytecode files which are generated after compilation.
	They are stored in cache so that they are easy to import and execute.

	Collection of modules (Python files) is a package (folder):

	1. import myPkg.moduleIntro
	2. import myPkg.moduleIntro as mp
	3. from myPkg.moduleIntro import *
	4. from myPkg.moduleIntro import funOne, dataOne
	5. from myPkg import moduleIntro
	6. from myPkg import moduleIntro as mi
